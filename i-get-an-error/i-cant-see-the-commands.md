# I can't see commands

### **1. Update your Discord app to the latest version.**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="On desktop" %}
Click on the green button at the top right of your app![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="On mobile" %}
Go to the app store that you downloaded Discord with and update it
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### **2. Restart your Discord app.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
On a computer, be sure to stop the discord process completely. Clicking on the cross at the top right is not enough if the "Minimise to Tray" option in "Windows Settings" is activated.
{% endhint %}

### **3. Allow the bot to create slash commands in your server.**

Go to [http://invite.coodo.xyz](http://invite.coodo.xyz) and invite the bot on your server and keep all permissions requested by the bot, otherwise some of its functions will not be available.

### **4. Make sure you have enabled the "Use Application Commands" permission**

* Go to your server's settings
* Go to the roles tab settings
* Choose the `@everyone` role
* Scroll down to the `Text Channel Permissions` section and enable the `Use Application Commands` permision
