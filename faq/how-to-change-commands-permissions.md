# How to change commands permissions?

**How do I access Command Permissions?**

On desktop, go to `Server Settings` > `Integrations`, and select `Strawpoll` bot from the list. You’ll see a list of commands and ways to control access to them!



**How do I restrict who can use commands?**

Under `Roles and Members` you’ll see a list of who currently has permissions to use commands. You can make changes by changing the toggle, just like other permissions, or adding additional roles and members.



**How do I turn commands off within specific channels?**

We know that servers have different needs, and you may want to restrict commands to certain channels. By default, commands are available in all channels. This means **when you add the bot to your server, all members will be able to use any commands**.

To restrict access to certain spaces, click `Add Channels` and select additional channels to customize. Toggle permissions off as desired.



**Can I change permissions for a specific command?**

You can make changes to individual commands by creating overwrites. Clicking a command in the list will open a popup where you can make changes.
